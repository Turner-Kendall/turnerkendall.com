# TurnerKendall.com

The Vue / Vite site source for turnerkendall.com.  Feel free to clone it and use it to start your project if you wish.  As of now there is not much content - As I migrate all of the other content here it will be less useful for that but I will continue to make it available.  Maybe I should version it?

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
