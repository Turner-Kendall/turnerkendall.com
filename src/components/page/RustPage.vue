          ðŸ¦€ Rust is trendy for several (compelling) reasons. Here are my top reasons for investing my time learning it.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Memory Safety: Rust addresses memory-related issues that languages like C and C++ have struggled with. It ensures better memory safety by catching memory errors at compile time, reducing the risk of runtime crashes and security vulnerabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Zero-Cost Abstraction: Rust allows high-level abstractions without sacrificing performance. You can write expressive code without worrying about overhead, thanks to Rust's efficient compilation
          </li>
          <li>
            Control Over Low-Level Details: Rust gives developers the choice of managing memory on the stack or heap. It determines memory cleanup at compile time, ensuring efficient resource usage
          </li>
          <li>
            Growing Ecosystem: Rust's ecosystem is expanding rapidly. It's used in various domains, from systems programming to web development (e.g., Dropbox, Firefox) and even embedded systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Type Safety: Rust's static type system catches errors early, promoting long-term maintainability. Unlike some statically-typed languages, Rust avoids null-related issues by using an optional type.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scalability and Concurrency: Rust is suitable for building heavy applications, including IoT projects. Its logical and functional syntax facilitates low-level programming.
          </li>        
        </ul>

        <p class="coda">
          Rust combines the speed of low-level languages with the safety of high-level languages making it an excellent choice for modern software development and not surprisingly the job market for Rust developers is booming ðŸš€
