          Can I create a Vite / Vue3 Single Page Web App in less than 24 hours?
        </p>

          That's what I was asking myself when I realized I had a sliver of time in my hectic schedule this week.  Could I 
          spin up and deploy a SPA dictionary in the small amount of time I had <i>free</i>.  I needed a front end example to 
          show a potential client how I do Vue as an app. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Obviously an online dictionary is hardly revolutionary, but as an example of how I like to use 
          <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> this will do.

        <p>The 24 hour angle was interesting - I know deadlines but 24 hours is fast!  That's everything from vite@latest to deployment
          to <a href="https://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>.  The Domain was a dollar at <a href="https://namecheap.com">Namecheap</a>  ðŸ˜¸
