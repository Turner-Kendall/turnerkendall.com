          Thankfully I learned Go first as I struggled with pointers, interfaces, etc. but had no 
          trouble with them in Rust as I learned the concepts well previously.  
          Once you get past the borrow checker, understand Option and Result, 
          and get generics and traits - <a href="/page/rust">Rust</a> starts getting fun.

          I also like Vue3, MySQL, and Pandas.  Python might be clunky but Pandas 
          is as good of a package as I have ever used.

          can manipulate it ways never intended. Here's a link to <a href="/page/link">some other things I like.</a>
