    <p class="intro">
      I am a software developer with a passion for data and crypto. I am currently working on a 
      variety of projects focusing on distributed systems and privacy in Rust.
    </p>
    
    <p>I am proficient in Python, Javascript, and Go. I am still learning Rust but 
      I am getting better at it every day.  <a href="/page/more">Even More...</a> </p>

    <p>
      I am always on the lookout for interesting opportunities. While I have been focused on the 
      backend lately I speak html / css / js fluently.
