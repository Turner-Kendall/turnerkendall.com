    <p class="intro">
      I am a software developer with a passion for data and crypto. I am currently working on a 
      variety of projects focusing on distributed systems and privacy in Rust.
    </p>
    
    <p>I am proficient in Python, Javascript, and Go. I am still learning Rust but 
      I am getting better at it every day.  </p>
      
    <p>
      Thankfully I learned Go first as I struggled with pointers, interfaces, etc. but had no 
      trouble with them in Rust as I learned the concepts well previously.  
      Once you get past the borrow checker, thoroughly understand Option and Result, 
      and start getting generics and traits - Rust starts getting fun.
    </p>
 
    <p>I also like Vue3, MySQL, and Pandas.  Python might be clunky but Pandas 
      is as good of a package as I have ever used. 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Turner-Kendall/json_tweets">I like JSON</a> way more than is warranted and 
      can manipulate it ways never intended.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am always on the lookout for interesting professional opportunities.  I am       often willing 
      to take less money to work on fun or interesting projects.  While I have been focused on the 
      backend lately I speak html / css / js fluently.
